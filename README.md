I am currently a CS Student at [University of Economics in Katowice](https://www.ue.katowice.pl/no_cache/en.html)  

So far, I have been experimenting and learning different languages and technologies to see what I like the most.

I used to create simple games using C++ with SDL 2, but recently I started learning to use Python with Pygame Zero, as well as how to create desktop aps using QT's qml.
